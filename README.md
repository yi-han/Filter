# IDA

IDA is the first self-learning DDoS penetration tool created as part of my masterâ€™s thesis.

It allows researchers to evaluate the effectiveness of a proposed defence against an intelligent attacker. Traditionally, network evaluation is performed through simulation against common attacks.

Through Deep Reinforcement Learning, IDA learns a policy designed to minimise the effectiveness of the network defender. Therefore, IDA can be used to provide a defence metric used to compare the effectiveness of defenders against intelligent attacks.

Using a black box design, IDA will adapt to any network defender and learns a tailored attack strategy through network interaction.

IDA was used to evaluate four different network defenders. IDA was seen to match or outperform all common attack strategies that are commonly used for evaluation purposes. IDA identified a new vulnerability in the previously published MARL defender by devising a unique Pulse Attack. 

This repository is designed to allow the user to run IDA to evaluate Yau's Fair Throttle Defender.

A detailed explanation of IDA can be found in the included draft publication or in Chapter 4 of the included thesis.
